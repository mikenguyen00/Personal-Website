        This Project was my final project for ECE 3300L. The project criteria was to implement a mealy or moore machine into our program. 
        I chose to do a music player for this project. I picked moore because it was simple. It has two states because it has two songs stored in the program. 
        It also use the button and switch on the FPGA board to pause, play, or skip.
